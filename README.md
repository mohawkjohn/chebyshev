Chebyshev polynomial fitting and evaluation (implementation based on Numerical Recipes)

This code is proprietary! It's from Numerical Recipes, by William Press. It is just my implementation of it in Ruby.

I don't particularly care what you use it for, but Bill Press will care. In other words, this is for your reference only.
